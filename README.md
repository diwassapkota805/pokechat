# POKÉCHAT

## Overview
POKÉCHAT is a web application that explores human-AI interactions using Pokémon datasets and large language models. This project enhances web programming skills through dynamic pages, participatory and encyclopedic affordances, and third-party API integration.

## Features
- **Dynamic Pages**: Built with React components.
- **Participatory & Encyclopedic Affordances**: User interactions designed to maximize these affordances.
- **CSS Frameworks**: Attractive UIs created using Semantic UI.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Data fetching from external sources.

## Project Components

### 1. Pokedex App
Utilizes Semantic UI to present a visually appealing Pokedex app with data fetched from the Pokémon API.

- **Tech**: Semantic UI, Axios, React
- **Highlights**: Color-coded Pokémon types, detailed cards, clickable sprites

### 2. Chat Interaction
Features a chat interface that interacts with a large language model (GPT-3.5) to generate responses based on user queries about Pokémon.

- **Tech**: React, Axios, Flask, Python
- **Highlights**: Real-time query handling, user-friendly chat interface

### 3. Concept Interaction
Designs a human-AI interaction model using the Pokémon dataset, maximizing encyclopedic and participatory affordances.

- **Tech**: Figma (for prototypes)
- **Highlights**: Medium to high fidelity prototypes, detailed design documentation
